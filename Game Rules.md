- The bank starts with Credits equal to the number of tiles
- Each Player starts with 6 Credits (2 per owned tile). Each Foreign Nation starts with 8 Credits per owned tile.

# Turn Structure & General Rules
- If a player tries to activate a card they cannot meet the conditions or pay the cost of, negate the card.
- If an effect of a Foreign Nation or an event card requires players to pay X and the player cannot pay, X + 1 is paid from MoC. If MoC cannot pay the amount, then the Player Nation takes a loan. A loan lasts X turns, and while it lasts, the MoC has to pay 2 Credits to the Bank at the end of each phase. There can be multiple loans active at the same time, however if the number of loans exceeds 4, then it is game over.
- If an effect causes the bank to pay a Nation and there is not enough credits in the bank, the Nation chooses 
- At the end of their turn, players may discard upto half of their hand (rounded up) and draw upto their hand limit, wihch is 5 by default. Default actions do not affect the hand limit and canot be discarded.

    - If the max KS has increased, add Credits equal to the number of tiles in the game.
