# Current Release

Using influence to strengthen intellegence check

Total GDP possible for all Nations (aka the bank). Increases with the KS, the "wealth" of a nation is based on percentage owned, and if a Nation cannot withdraw from the bank, they do so from other players

Agreements are terminated if the relations fall below a certain level at the end of a phase

Whenever a card says "your nation must pay X", that comes out of MoC. If they cannot pay, incur penalties (TODO: figure out possible penalties)

integrate TI's combat a bit (each player rolls dice to hit. Players decide which of their units get hit)

unit upgrades (increased chance to hit, more hitpoints, abilities...)
