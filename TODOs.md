# Current Release

Using influence to strengthen intellegence check

Total GDP possible for all Nations (aka the bank). Increases with the KS, the "wealth" of a nation is based on percentage owned, and if a Nation cannot withdraw from the bank, they do so from other players

Agreements are terminated if the relations fall below a certain level at the end of a phase

Whenever a card says "your nation must pay X", that comes out of MoC. If they cannot pay, incur penalties (TODO: figure out possible penalties)

integrate TI's combat a bit (each player rolls dice to hit. Players decide which of their units get hit)

unit upgrades (increased chance to hit, more hitpoints, abilities...)

- Increasing intellegence should be a basic action for MoD. the effect should be:
    - Do an Intellegence Check against a Foreign Nation. If successful, increase intellegence against that Nation by 1. Otherwise, decrease relations with that Nation by 1.
- Increasing/Decresing relations should be a basic action for MoFA. The effect should be:
    - Choose a Nation. You may decrease relations by 1 with them (given no nuclear war), or you may roll a Diplomacy check instead and increase relations by 1 if successful

- Armies
    - Armies and nukes have an upkeep cost
    - Bully Foreign Nations and prevent Foreign Nations from bullying you
        - This will be a MoFA action/ other Nations' cards
    - (?) Prevent Foreign Nations from using their armies against each other or neutral countries
        -  other Nations' cards
- Covert Actions
    - Prevent covert actions being done to you
        - other Nations will do an intellegence check against your nation
    - Have intellegence levels between countries, which will determine what you can do to Foreign Nations and what they can do to you, and the chances of successful covert actions.

# Next Release
- (?) Foreign Nations to increase/decrease relations with each other, MoFA to take advantage of it
- Foreign Nation personalities, stats (e.g. how difficult it is to win Diplomacy Check against them, # of cards of each type...). The "capital tile" (e.g. corner tile) determines some/all of the personality traits. Capturing a Foreign Nation's capital grants the players the ability to use that Nation's effects.
- (?) Player objectives
- Event Deck
- (?) More interactions (treaties, covert actions...) between Nations and Nations gaining advantage by being on a tile (e.g. their Credits)
- (?) Victory Conditions
- MoFA should be able to react to aggressions of Foreign Nations (reduce relations etc)
- (?) Foreign Nations can lose Credits based on troop upkeep and gain Credits = # of territories owned
- A set of capital tiles, one of which will be randomly assigned to the players' Nation which will give a unique effect
    - Or, give "civ" cards randomly betweem players (?)
